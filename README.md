# Text-Completion-Generator

1. Project Title:
Text Completion Generator using Generative AI

2. Domain:
•	Generative AI 
•	NLP 
•	Sentence Completion

3. Problem Statement:
Understanding and generating coherent text is a critical challenge in NLP. The ability to predict the next sentence based on context is fundamental to building intelligent applications such as chatbots, content generators, and summarizers. The project aims to build a Gen AI-based system that can predict or suggest the most appropriate next sentence for a given input.

4. Proposed Solution:
This project aims to develop a Next Sentence Prediction system leveraging pre-trained Generative AI models. The system will:
•	Accept a user-input paragraph or sentence as the initial prompt.
•	Utilize a language model to generate one or more likely continuations.
•	Evaluate and rank the generated sentences based on their coherence and contextual relevance.
•	Offer potential for future expansion into story generation or intelligent text auto-completion.

5. Objectives:
•	Develop a functional prototype that predicts the next sentence using Generative AI models.
•	Explore and experiment with different large language models (such as GPT and fine-tuned BERT) for Next Sentence Prediction tasks.
•	Design an interactive interface to facilitate testing and validation of the predicted outputs.

6. Expected Outcome:
•	A lightweight NLP application capable of accurately generating the next sentence.
•	A demo web page or application that accepts a sentence input and returns one or more predicted continuations.

7. Tools & Technologies to be Used:
- Python (Primary programming language)
- Transformers library (by HuggingFace)
- Pre-trained models: GPT-2, GPT-Neo, or BERT (for NSP baseline)
- Flask/Streamlit for web interface
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation
- Google Colab / Local GPU for model inference
